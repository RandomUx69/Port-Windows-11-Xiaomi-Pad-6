## ⚠️ WARNING ⚠️
> [!NOTE]
> - We're not responsible for bricked devices, missing recovery partitions, dead xiaomi factoryline ~workers~ cowboys, dead pmics, dead ram, dead display ics, dead cpus, any xiaomi shenanigans, dead cats or dogs, nuclear wars or you getting fired because you forgot to boot back into android for the alarm (use Windows Alarms app).
> - This project is in late stages of development, and this has all credits going STRAIGHT to erdilS for making this awesome project, all the files here have been contributed by other users, here you will find a guide with the working files we managed to get. This is a delicate process, do it under your own risk and follow all the steps carefully.
> - NO DRIVERS YET! VERY UNSTABLE PROJECT! DRIVERS ARE WIP (Work In Progress), AND ARE NOT TO BE COMING TILL THE NEXT MONTH OR TWO.

> [!WARNING]
> **If you're not comfortable with modding your tablet or its partition table, or worried about bricking your device, it's okay to take a step back. But the process is simple, so even beginners can handle it. Just follow the instructions carefully, and you should be fine.**


> [!CAUTION]
> **❗For everyone wanting WoA drivers, we are currently making them. Be patient, folks.❗**

> [!TIP]
> **Want to see Xiaomi Pad 6 WoA actively maintained and updated?**
>
> **If anyone here is interested in keeping pipa WoA alive, there's a chance to make it happen:**  
> A device could be sent to ME as a surprise — but someone would need to cover the cost.
>
> The sender doesn't own the device and has no reason to spend money on it personally, but is willing to coordinate the gift.
>
> ~**Estimated cost: $70–120**, depending on current listings when enough donations are collected.~
>
> What this would mean:
> - Driver creation sped up :D
> - Potential performance improvements
> - Surprises
>
> ~Donations can be made via [BuyMeACoffee](https://buymeacoffee.com/realfooking)  ~~
> Crypto also accepted — DM [the sog](https://t.me/realfooking) on Telegram for wallet address.~
>
> **❤️‍🔥Thank you to everyone who donated. We reached our goal for the new device; it has been purchased and is on its way to the developer.**
